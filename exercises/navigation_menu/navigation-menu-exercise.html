    <title>exercise - Navigation Menu</title>
</head>
<!-- Instructions: -->
<!-- Note: this is an exercise that will require some JavaScript and CSS. We've set up functions for you to use in the JavaScript file for the expected ARIA properties and values, or feel free to write your own logic. -->
<!-- 1. Navigate through the navigation menu links with your screen reader enabled. Find any visibly hidden links that are still in the focus order and hide them from assistive technology. -->
<!-- 2. For the sub-menu that is shown under "Activities" add any ARIA attributes that would make this more accessible (hint: there are two!). Use the JavaScript file to toggle the value of these properties if they should change depending on the open/closed state.-->
<!-- 3. Bonus: resize your browser down to a viewport where the mobile menu appears. Add any ARIA attributes to both the "hamburger menu" control and the sub-menu under "Activities" for the mobile menu that would make this more accessible (hint: there are two!) Use the JavaScript file to toggle the value of these properties if they should change depending on the open/closed state. -->
<!-- 4. Bonus: use an ARIA attribute to mark the current page and attach a style to this property in the CSS to distinuish the current page both visually and for assistive technologies. (hint: you will need to use JavaScript and CSS for this.)-->
